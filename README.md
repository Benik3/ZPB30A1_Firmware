# ZPB30A1 Firmware

This repository is there to build an open-source firmware for the ZPB30A1 chinese 60W electronic load.

The original firmware is protected and therefore could not been read and improved partially. :warning: They also activated the write protection, ~~so unfortunately **you have to replace the IC on the board**. But the processors are available at almost no cost on the same platform you bought the load on ;-) (or up to a quadruple of the price at regular distributors)~~
You should be able to unlock the MCU by flashing 0x00 option bytes through SWIM e.g. with graphic STVP. Not tested yet. You will of course lost original FW...
So if you plan to buy a load like this and want to "upgrade", consider ordering ~~the processor and~~ a cheap STLink V2 too (if you haven't got one already).

I-SET runs now at 571 Hz, which gives also good results.

## Software

~It seems like they have activated the Read Out Protection, so when running a flash readout, it just dumps zeros.~ Using STVP-STM32 on Windows confirmed my guess and made it even worse. So not only the ROP is set, the write protection is also set. So there neither real software reverse engineering possible nor can you recycle the existing processor. Software needed to be build from scratch.

As there are just a few compilers out there and just one open source solution, we'll be using [Small Device C Compiler (SDCC)](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).

### Functions

Development started using a STM8S Discovery, which is using a STM8S003K3. This is incompatible with the 005 on the load, as UART2 is UART1, PWM on FAN is not available and there are no internal PullUps on the encoder pins.

- [ ] Different modes:
  - [x] CC (Constant Current, as default)
  - [x] CW (Constant Power)
  - [x] CR (Constant Resistance)
  - [ ] BAT (Battery capacity test)
- [x] Continous output of data via UART now with support for Logview
- [ ] Logging of Ah, Wh, J (?) in every mode
- [ ] Adjusting shunt resistance (if replaced with e.g. 100 mΩ for an offset as low as 20 mA instead of 200 mA, not the resistance itself but the value in software)
  - :information_source: ~~Not needed, we can safely trim the current down to almost 0 mA by PWM~~ From my testing minimum current is 130mA.
- [ ] Toggle beeper, auto shutdown
  - Currently beeper is working but it needs more function
- [x] Nice menus even though we got just that small seven segments


### Specifications

| Param           | Range    | Value
| --------------- | -------- | ---
| Voltage Input   | 0-30 V   | ± 0.3% ± 20 mV (oversampling the 10 bit ADC to get 12 fake bit)
| Current control | 0-10 A   | ± 0.1% ± 1 mA
| Temperature     | 30-90°C  | ± 1.5 °C

Due to multiplication of the tolerances in constant power and constant resistance mode no concrete specifications are given.

| `Err2` | V<sub>BATT</sub> &lt; V<sub>THRESHOLD</sub>, reversed or not connected
| `Err3` | Line resistance to high; The set current can't be delivered
| `Err4` | Circuit failed somewhere somehow. [Unknown error]
| `Err6` | Input voltage is inapropiate (12V/0.5A), if using a correct power supply, check PB3 and PD3 for shorts or open contacts
| `Otp`  | Over temperature protection [if everything is cool, check the thermistor value @ 25°C / 77°F]
| `Ert`  | Temperature sensore failure or temperature too low
